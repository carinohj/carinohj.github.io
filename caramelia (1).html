  <h1>for my lili 😽</h1>

  <div class="scene">
    <p>if i could teleport to you rn, what’s the first thing you think i’d do? 🤍</p>
    <p>would i hug you tight from behind? or cup your face and give you forehead kisses till you melt? 😻</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <p>what if we were lying under a blanket, legs tangled... would you let me trace little hearts on your skin while we talk about everything and nothing? 😽</p>
    <p>would you blush when i whisper how pretty you are in your ear? 🤍</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <p>if i sent you a playlist called “songs that remind me of my girl,” would you press play immediately? 😻</p>
    <p>or would you get flustered and tease me first before listening on loop? 🤍</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <p>would you sit in my lap if we were watching a movie, or make me pull you onto it? 😽</p>
    <p>and when the credits roll, would you fall asleep on my chest while i play with your hair? 🤍</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <p>okay... now imagine me saying: "be honest, baby..."</p>
    <p>“do you think about me when you touch yourself?” 😽</p>
    <p>“would you let me take care of that for you sometime?” 😻</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reward">
    💌 your reward: i’ve been thinking about writing you something way more raw... wanna unlock it, baby? text me the word: <strong>"LIPBITE"</strong> 😽💋
  </div>
